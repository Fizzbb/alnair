* Add Specifier ```__global__``` to functions, which tells the CUDA C++ compiler that this is a function that runs on GPU and call be called from CPU, those ```__global__``` functions are know as kernels.

* CUDA kernel launches are specified using the triple angle bracket syntax ```<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>```, execution configuration

* CUDA kernel launches donâ€™t block the calling CPU thread, if need the CPU to wait until the kernel is done before it accesses the results, add cudaDeviceSynchronize()

* ```nvcc -x cu``` option allows us to write CUDA code directly in cpp file, Jupyter supports .cpp syntax hightlighting
```
